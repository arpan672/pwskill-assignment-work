 1. can store any kind of data 
    its is immutable type of data type 
    written within the parethethissis 
    it is indexed 
    can be sliced and tuple word is used as a keyword to change any data type into a tuple 
  
  2.  count() and index() are the two methode in the tuple
      count() it take a argument and give the no of occurence  of the given input in the tuple 
      index () it alse take a argument and give the first index of that argument as a outpur 
      
      
   3.set is the collection of datatypes inpython do not allow duplicate item 
     a=[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,5,6,7,8,4,5,6,78,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]#  this is the list with multiple duplicate 
     b=set(a)
     b # now only unik element will remain in the list as a set 
     
   4. in union () methode we combine the common element between the two set and make a one new unique set as a output
      set 3 = set1.union(set2)
      in update ()methode we add a some different element to the set in which a updata methode is called upon 
      set1.update(set2) now set1 will be modified to the new set of element 
   5. dictionary is the collection of the data set with the key and value pair of every key 
      and key will be always unique 
      and it is oudered but not indexed and can be extract the value with the help of the key 
      dict1={key:value_pair , key1:value_pair1}
      
   6. yes we can create the nested dictionary 
     ex :::
     dict1={arpan:{name:arpan tiwarei, sirname:tiwari, place : mp(bakiya), state: madhyapradesh}, nitesh: my younger brother}
      
   7   dict1={"arpan":{"name":"arpan tiwarei, sirname:tiwari, place : mp(bakiya), state: madhyapradesh" }, "nitesh": "my younger brother" }
       dict1.setdefault("language","python" )
       dict1.setdefault("course" , "data science masters")
        setdault is the methode which add a new key and it value pair to dictionay
